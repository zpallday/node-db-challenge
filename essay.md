<!-- Relational databases are stuctures that contains data where as sql ia data that is maniplation language responsible for CRUD of the data with said databases -->

<!-- Refenece without the ability to be altered -->

<!-- A foreign key that used to create links between tables. They're 
unigue integers, and they use to connect a record in one table to a second table. -->

<!-- A third table must be introduced with foreign keys linking 
the two original tables -->
